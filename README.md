# Origin Policy

Origin policy was a proposal for a web platform mechanism that allows origins to set their origin-wide configuration in a central location, instead of using per-response HTTP headers. Please check out [previous revisions of this repository](https://github.com/WICG/origin-policy/tree/7354568d2492d6847f68da21df46274df50c374a) to learn more about the most-recent proposed attempt, including details on the problems it was trying to solve.

It is currently on hold as no browser vendors are investing in it. But, some folks still believe it is worth considering in the future. If you wish to reboot such efforts, this repository is a good place to start, and you could even reuse the old explainer material and spec text if you wish.

You can also learn about one editor's [thoughts on why this is a hard problem space](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jptq14gPpuBt3933-Hns2wwrHIW6qpo3xu6Xkfs12N4/edit#), which might be worth considering for such future attempts.
